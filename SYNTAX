There are only 3 syntax elements – pi, pika and pikachu.
Repeating the same syntax element 3 times in a row is not allowed.
Pikachu makes use of 2 pikachus(stacks) – Pi Pikachu and Pika Pikachu.

If a line ends with  pi pikachu or pika pikachu, perform operations on that
specified pikachu based on the commands preceding it:

pi pika -- Add the top element of the pikachu to the next top element, and push
	the result on to the pikachu

pika pi -- Subtract the top element of the pikachu from the next top element,
	and push the result on to the pikachu

pi pikachu -- Multiply the top element of the pikachu to the next top element,
	and push the result on to the pikachu

pikachu -- Divide the second top element of the pikachu by the top element,
	and push the result on to the pikachu

pika pikachu -- Pop the value on top of the pikachu and print it.

pikachu pikachu -- Pop the value on top of the pikachu and print its equivalent
	ASCII character.

stack name only (nothing else) -- Pop the value on top of the pikachu.

*n number of terms* -- Push the number of terms – n – on to the pikachu.
	Make sure that no syntax element pi, pika or pikachu is repeated 3 times in
	a row.

The following 4 commands operate on both the pi pikachu and the pika pikachu.
Therefore, these lines also don’t need to end with the name of an individual
pikachu:

pi pika -- Copy the top of pi pikachu to pika pikachu.

pika pi -- Copy the top of pika pikachu to pi pikachu.

pikachu pikachu -- If the top of pi pikachu and pika pikachu are equal, go to
	line number n, where n is the number of terms in the immediate next line.

pika pika -- If the top of pi pikachu and pika pikachu are inequal, go to line
	number n, where n is the number of terms in the immediate next line.

Note : Inputs are initially added to pi pikachu
